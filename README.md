T2Flow Renderer
===============
You will need to install [Ruby][1], [GraphViz][2] (specifically, `dot`) and the
[Taverna 2 Parser Gem][3] on your container host to use this code. This
is _in addition to_ a Java webapp container.

It's a little web application that takes a `POST`ed t2flow and returns
the SVG rendering of it.
